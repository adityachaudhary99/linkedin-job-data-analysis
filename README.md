# LinkedIn-Job-Data-Analysis

Welcome to the **LinkedIn Job Data Analysis** repository! This project aims to to analyze LinkedIn job data for the first quarter of 2024 to answer questions such as:

1. What skills are most in demand by employers for specific job roles?
2. What is the job posting trend overtime?
3. What is the distribution of job levels for specific job roles?
4. What is the distribution of job types for specific job roles?
5. What are the top 10 required skills for a specific job role according to data?

**For this project, We will be using this specific job role as "Machine Learning Engineer".**

By extracting relevant LinkedIn data, we can explore career paths, identify trends, and make informed decisions related to talent sourcing, workforce development, and industry insights.
